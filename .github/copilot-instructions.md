## Project Summary
- The project sets up a 4-node Lustre cluster with Slurm.
- It uses Vagrant and VirtualBox to provision MDS/MGS, OSS, client, and compute nodes.
    - **lustre-server** is installed on MDS/MGS and OSS nodes.
    - **lustre-client** is installed on the client and compute nodes.
    - **Slurm** is installed on the OSS, client, and compute nodes.
    - **Slurm control daemon** is installed on the MDS/MGS node.
- Slurm final configuration is done with the script `setup_slurm.sh`, which SCPs the `slurm_update_config.sh` script to the VMs and runs it on each VM.
- The Lustre file system is mounted on the client and compute node at `/lustre/vagrant`.
- Instructions include how to launch, configure Slurm, and monitor Lustre using collectl.
- **Always check** the `Vagrantfile`, `setup_slurm.sh`, and `slurm_update_config.sh` for the environment configuration.
